#### Let me introduce myself or I'm ready to change my life!

I'm unemployed now. I haven't worked since February 2020. I didn't want to work as an economist anymore. It was so bored.
There were no perspectives, no development, no good salary. Enough! And I decided to change my life. I started to search online IT-cources,
because IT is highly developing field and you can achieve all that you want. I like computers and ideas of development.
I like to learn new things. It is very interesting. I want to develope myself and to make the world around me more developed.
My motto is **well done - well rested!**

*But don't have enough skills to make up websites now. So i started the Rolling Scopes course for developers.*

*It is my second course for developers! My first one was in my hometown before pandemic.*

But it was only 3 or 4 lessons and then it was cancelled by organisators.

I have studied English since i was pupil in my school. In addition I graduated English cources in 2019.(Pre-Intermidiate level).
I am constantly improving my English skills.
